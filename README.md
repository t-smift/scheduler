# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a single-page web app that allows a user to book an appointment from a list of interviewers. The app offers interview times between 12pm and 5pm, Monday through Friday, where users can book, edit and delete scheduled appointments.

Created by Taylor Smith as part of the Lighthouse Labs full-time web development bootcamp program.
